Not a nautilus-terminal user, but I came across it looking for this type of functionality. KDE has Dolphin which does have an integrated terminal that seems to work pretty well. I like gnome and the simplicity + choose your own adventure with gnome extensions. So, as mentioned before, expanding upon the APIs that Nautilus offers to gnome extensions could be the best bet. Iâ€™m a fan of Wezterm, so the opportunity for extension developers to offer different terminal experiences in Nautilus would be neat.
